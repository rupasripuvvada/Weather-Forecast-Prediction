# Weather-Forecast-Prediction

🌦️ Weather Forecast Prediction Project

📌 Overview

This project is a Weather Prediction System built using Python and Machine Learning. It processes weather datasets, trains machine learning models, and predicts conditions such as temperature, humidity, or rainfall using Random Forest models for both classification and regression tasks.

The goal of this project is to apply data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to make accurate weather predictions.


⚙️ Features

🌍 Fetch weather data using APIs (Requests library)

📊 Data cleaning & preprocessing with Pandas & NumPy

🔍 Label Encoding for categorical features

🤖 Random Forest Classifier & Regressor for predictions

🧪 Train-Test Split for model evaluation

📈 Performance measurement with accuracy score / R² score


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (Core language)

Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling & Analysis)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning models)

Requests (API calls for live data)


🚀 How It Works

Load the dataset into the notebook.

Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical data).

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train a Random Forest Classifier/Regressor model.

Evaluate the model on test data.

Use the trained model to make predictions.

Use API to fetch real-time weather data and apply the model.
